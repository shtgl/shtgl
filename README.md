## Hi! Welcome to open-source space

<div align="justify">
I’ve open-sourced some of my projects and ideas on GitHub. It took time to figure many things out from scratch. I tried writing explanations that actually make sense. The goal is helping people find the right information. It’s also a place for clearer answers, without overcomplicating things.
